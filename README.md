# PhotonVirtualReality
Integrating Photon in my Virtual Reality game for mulitplayer


# Overview

In this project, I created a Multiplayer game in VR using Photon servers. This project was meant to help my understanding with certain integration of using Photon servers in Unity. As I create more projects, I will get used to working with this technology more easily. 

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote.}
The software that was implemented in this project will use Photon Sever Id to integrate in Unity, allowing for a connection to be set. This will allow for my movement to be broadcasted for others who join this particular room. I implemented Photon callbacks, which methods that are called after a certain task is failed or successful to check if there is a connection to the servers or not. 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
The purpose of writing this software was to check for connections between players across Photon servers.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
For this project, I created using Unity's platform for Virtual reality development. In the Unity registry, I was able to use their XR toolkit to enable Virtual Reality 
in this scene project. I used Jetbrainer as my source of IDE to write the code in. In this project, I used Photon to enable connections for multiplayer in Unity.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
This project is built on C#, which is the standard for creating Unity Projects. The libraries I used were from Photon, which implemented callback feeds and also XR toolkit libraries for a player movement. 


# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Create more worlds
- Have the UI stick to the hand instead of appearing infront
